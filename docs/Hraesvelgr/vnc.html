<h1> VNC: Using Windows Remotely</h1>

<p>
<b>It is possible to use Hraesvelgr remotely via ssh.</b>
However, there is no x-forwarding available. For this reason, 
I have installed a VNC server to Hraesvelgr (and its backup, Nidhogg).
The port number for this server is 5900, and the password is the same as
the user login. <b>You must be on the UMN network, either physically
or by VPN, for VNC to work.</b>
