<h1> SSH: Switching and sharing between Windows and Linux</h1>

<h2> For those already familiar with SSH </h2>
<p>
The linux machine recognizes its name (midgardsormr). I have also set up a few nicknames, "mid", "middy", and "midgard." 
These nicknames also include X-Forwarding as the `-Y` flag.
The X-server on this machine is configured to run at startup, so this should work automatically. 
There is also an SSH key already set up for connecting to Middy.
SSH is configured to work through PowerShell, so you should not need to install anything like PuTTY to connect.
</p>

<h2> For the uninitiated </h2>
<p>
If you want to run commands on Linux, you will need to either <a href="#direct">switch computers</a> or follow the steps below.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Press [Win]+R to open the Run menu.</li>
    <li>Enter "powershell" to launch a terminal (or run another terminal of your choice).</li>
    <li>Type "ssh middy".</li>
</ol>
You are now connected to Midgardsormr.

<h1 id="#direct"> Using Linux directly </h1>

<p>
Midgardsormr is also connected to this monitor via HDMI and to the mouse and keyboard using a KVM switch.
</p><p>
On the monitor, press any button (besides the power button) to pull up the main menu,
then the second button from the left to open the input selection menu. 
</p><p>
The KVM switch is the black box with several cords coming out of it. 
There is an LED indicator telling you which device you're currently outputting to &mdash;
these outputs are all labeled.
